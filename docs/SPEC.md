## Spec

This file is the shared task queue for all agents working in this repo.

## Status Legend

- `todo`: ready to claim
- `in_progress`: currently owned by one agent
- `blocked`: cannot proceed until the blocker is resolved
- `done`: completed and validated for the scoped task

## Coordination Rules

- Claim work by changing a task from `todo` to `in_progress` and setting `Owner`.
- Do not edit another agent's `in_progress` task without an explicit handoff or user direction.
- When work is finished, change `Status` to `done` and add a short `Completion` note when useful.
- If all tasks are `done`, stop and ask the user to add or prioritize new work.

## Task Template

Use this format for all new tasks:

### TASK-ID Short Title

- Status: `todo`
- Owner: `unassigned`
- Depends On: `none`
- Summary: One sentence describing the scoped change.
- Acceptance: Observable outcome that confirms the task is complete.
- Completion:

Notes:

- Use a stable ID like `UI-05`, `GAME-02`, or `ART-06`.
- Keep each task small enough for one focused pass.
- Set `Depends On` to one or more task IDs when order matters.
- Leave `Completion` blank until the task is finished.

## Active Queue

Add all new `todo`, `in_progress`, and `blocked` tasks in this section.
Keep the highest-priority ready work at the top so agents can claim it quickly.

## Completed Work

Add all `done` tasks here.
